TODO
----
- LFMM: add an option to follow the log-likelihood along the run for 
convergence.

- LFMM: an NA can appear for a long run for 940 individuals and 220000 SNPs, 
sometimes.

- sNMF: check that the disjonctive code 100, 010, 001 is really necessary. 
In practice, coding 00, 10, 01 is faster because the number of columns in
the genotypic matrice will be 2*L instead of 3*L.

- Makefile: the makefil can probably be improved.

- test: ... create long-term usable test structure...
