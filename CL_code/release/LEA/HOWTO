HOW TO, add a new function to LEA
*********************************

In meta/LEA/, add:

- export(<the function>) in the namespace

- an R man page, in the man/ directory

- the C function link, R_<the function>.c, in the src/ directory.
This function wrap the principal C function of program. It is the equivalent
of the main_<the function>.c in C.

- update the Makevars with your new src directory.

- the R function, in the R/ directory.
Usually, this function check the argument, create a new class if necessary
and call associated C function, R_<the function>.c.

- the R class for the result, in the R/ directory.
Usually, the major program (LFMM, sNMF, ...) registers their runs in a class
(ex: snmfClass) and the project in an other class (ex: snmfProject)
Some methods are linked with these classes.

- update the vignette with the new function.

- update the inst/citation if it is necessary.
