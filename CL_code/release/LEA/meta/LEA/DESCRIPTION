Description:  LEA is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics and ecological association tests. LEA can run analyses of population structure and genome scans for local adaptation. It includes statistical methods for estimating ancestry coefficients from large genotypic matrices and evaluating the number of ancestral populations (sNMF, PCA); and identifying genetic polymorphisms that exhibit high correlation with some environmental gradient or with the variables used as proxies for ecological pressures (LFMM), and controlling the false discovery rate. LEA is mainly based on optimized C programs that can scale with the dimension of very large data sets.
