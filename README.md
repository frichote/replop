Phd project: a set of tools for population genetics

Description
-----------

This repository contains a set of codes used 
to develop the softwares of my Phd project. 

Organization
------------
The repository is organized as follows:

* CL\_code: command-line code directory.

* Eric.Frichot: personal webpage host by timc at the moment.

* GUI\_code: Graphical User Interface code directory for LFMM.

Softwares
----------
Here is the list of softwares.

### LFMM 
The **LFMM** computer program is an integrated framework 
based on population genetics, ecological modeling and 
statistical techniques for screening genomes for 
signatures of local adaptation.

The software **webpage** is [here](http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/lfmm.html). 

The **paper** is available [here](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/30/7/1687.full).

### sNMF

**sNMF** is a fast and efficient program for estimating 
individual admixture coefficients based on sparse non-negative 
matrix factorization and population genetics. 


The software **webpage** is [here](http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/snmf.html). 

The **paper** is available [here](http://www.genetics.org/content/early/2014/02/02/genetics.113.160572.abstract?sid=8d0577ff-bbb4-430d-a898-f6e4929d9c7f).

### LEA
**LEA** is an R package dedicated to landscape genomics and ecological 
association tests. LEA can run analyses of population structure and genome 
scans for local adaptation. 

The software **webpage** is [here](http://membres-timc.imag.fr/Olivier.Francois/lea.html). 

The **paper** is under review.
